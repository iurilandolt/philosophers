# philosophers

This project is a possible solution for E.W. Dijkstra's dinnig philosophers problem.
This project serves as an introduction to multithreaded programing, concurrency, 
shared memory space, data-races, deadlocks and other related concepts.

• One or more philosophers sit at a round table.

• The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.

• There are as many forks on the table as there are philosophers.

• A philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.

• When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. 

• Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation or all philosophers are full.

• Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.

• Philosophers don’t speak with each other.

• Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.
